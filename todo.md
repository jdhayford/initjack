## Notes
- Lets make the variation arrow buttons inset
- We should fix the chord switching, it should persist actual chords rather than weird deriving
- Right now our processing of the data takes a while on page load, might want to
  - a) persist the post processed data to avoid the repeated work and cut down on bundle size (40%)
- Need to help the onboarding (past just sending a demo vid)
  - Could just add the prebuilt thing to their page?
- Could build up more testers (reach out to some influencers maybe?), friends of friends
  - What needs to be done for that? More reporting, atleast honeybadger for problems, whats heap for lone wolves?
